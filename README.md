# cse210-ww-student-template - Felipe Corral
This is my copy of BYU's CSE 210 repository. 

This repository contained the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged folders by week. There is also an an empty sandbox project that can be used to play around with any concept you would like.

After this term all files should have been modified with my resolution for all activities.

May refer to default design plan markdown file DefaultDesignPlanner.md so we can personalize for all and each project on the course.
